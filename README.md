# Pokedex (Mobile)
![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

This is a mobile application built on React Native.  
Initially, I started this to try out some animations 😂 but it ended up teaching me lots about React (file organizations, alias path, etc.)  

**Note:** Data is imported from JSON file locally (Merged [Biuni](https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/blob/master/pokedex.json
)'s and [Fanzeyi](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)'s JSON files using [JSON Merger VSCode extension](https://github.com/A-amon/json-merger)) 

## How it works

**Note:** The *Moves* screen is empty
